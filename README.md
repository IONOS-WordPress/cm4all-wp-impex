To make a release :

- fetch remote changes including tags for branch main : `git fetch --tags origin main:main`

- merge `main` into `develop` (prevent creating a merge commit message) : `git rebase --no-ff main` or `git merge --no-commit --no-ff main`

- push develop to main to trigger release creation using ci : `git push origin develop:main`
