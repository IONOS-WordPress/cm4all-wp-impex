# Features

There are a lot of WordPress plugins offering Import Export capabilities.

ImpEx stands out with some unique features making it the perfect match for WordPress data management.

There ist built-in support for exporting/importing

- WordPress posts, pages, comments, categories, tags, custom post types, custom fields, users, taxonomies, navigation menus and more

- FSE related content like block patterns, global styles, templates and template parts

- WordPress media

For exporting additional data like third-party WordPress plugin settings or any other data, you can use the ImpEx API to configure your own [Export profiles](api/configuration.html#custom-profile-configuration).

## JSON export data format

ImpEx exports data in a [JSON](https://www.json.org/) format.

The data structure can be validated using the provided [ImpEx JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/) definitions (can be found [here](https://github.com/IONOS-WordPress/cm4all-wp-impex/tree/develop/docs/gh-pages/src/jsonschema)).

### Semantic versioning support

The ImpEx JSON Schema format has built-in semantic versioning support providing upgrade capabilities for older exported content.

### JSON Schema

The data format of ImpEx exports is described in the [ImpEx JSON Schema definition files](https://github.com/IONOS-WordPress/cm4all-wp-impex/tree/develop/docs/gh-pages/src/jsonschema).

There are a variety of tools for working with [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/).

## Extensibility

ImpEx provides a foundation of core functionality to easily integrate custom WordPress data into the export

### Third-party data integration

Third-party WordPress plugins and themes often persist data in custom database tables, `wp_options` or other data sources.

ImpEx provides [WordPress actions](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/hooks/actions/) and [WordPress filters](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/hooks/filters/) to integrate custom data into the export.

Third-party plugins can easily contribute their own data provider by registering [actions](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/hooks/actions/) and [filters](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/hooks/filters/) with ImpEx.

> A ImpEx Data Provider is a import /export definition exposes plugin data to be used by other developers to integrate the data in their own export.

### API

Custom profiles can be defined using the [ImpEx API](api/configuration.html).

That does not mean that your own code depends on the ImpEx plugin to be installed and active. ImpEx uses [WordPress actions](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/hooks/actions/) and [WordPress filters](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/hooks/filters/), so your plugin will also work fine is ImpEx is not installed.

The ImpEx API provides interfaces for

- Data provider

  Data provider expose data (Export) or consume data (Import). Typically a third-party plugin will register a Import Provider and Export Provider to ImpEx. Theses providers can be used by ImpEx profiles to integrate the plugin data into export and import.

- Profiles

  A ImpEx profile is a set of configuration options and tasks defining what data to export/import.

> ImpEx provides a foundation of helpers to create custom ImpEx profiles with a few lines for posts, database tables and wp_options.

## Managed WordPress support

If you operate your WordPress website using a managed WordPress hosting service, you often have limited or no direct access to the WordPress database / installation.

In these scenarios most WordPress Import / Export plugins will not work.

**ImpEx only needs access to the WordPress REST API. Works like a charm in almost any managed WordPress hosting environment.**

## Commandline interface (CLI)

[wp-cli](https://wp-cli.org/) is a great tool for managing WordPress installations. Unfortunately it needs direct access to the WordPress installation and database.

Thus ImpEx provides a [CLI interface](impex-cli.html) to interact with a WordPress installation using pure WordPress REST API. **The [ImpEx CLI](impex-cli.html) works perfectly on managed WordPress instances.**

## REST API support

ImPEx provides a [WordPress REST API](https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/) extension for importing and exporting data. [All ImpEx functions are available as REST API endpoints](index.html#rest-api).

## Scalability

It's easy to export a WordPress website with a few pages. But about a WordPress website with a lot of pages and hundreds of images ?

**ImpEx is designed to be scalable. It can can handle hundreds/thousands of pages/posts and media files from scratch.**

### Streaming API

ImpEx API is designed to import/export a WordPress website in _chunks_ of _slices_.

A chunk is a partial unit of the exported data. Its basically a directory containing a part of the exported slices. Each slice is a json file describing (and most times also containing) data like post(s) or any other WordPress data.

The API ist designed to be resumable. A aborted export (and even import) can be resumed at any time.

_cancel/resume support will be part of a future release._

## Import Framework for websites from third-party website builders

ImpEx is also a great choice to import a website from a third-party website builder or even a static website.

ImpEx provides a [NodeJS Framework to convert any existing content to ImpEx WordPress content](cm4all-wp-impex-generator/index.html) : [@cm4all-wp-impex/generator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cm4all-wp-impex/generator).

**Using [@cm4all-wp-impex/generator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cm4all-wp-impex/generator) you can convert html pages or any other content to WordPress content.**

Since this [package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cm4all-wp-impex/generator) provides an API you can easily add custom transformations to suppport third-party site builder specialties into valid ImpEx export data.

# Generating custom content

Even more, [@cm4all-wp-impex/generator](cm4all-wp-impex-generator/index.html) allows you to transform **any** data from anywhere into WordPress content.

There ist actually no limit - everything can be transformed into WordPress content using [@cm4all-wp-impex/generator](cm4all-wp-impex-generator/index.html). See the [Static website conversion tutorial](./cm4all-wp-impex-generator/static-website-tutorial.html) as a starting point.
