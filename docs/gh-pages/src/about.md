# About

The Impex plugin provides a modern way to import and export data from WordPress.

It provides

- a [WordPress REST API](https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/) extension for importing and exporting data

- a user interface for interacting with the Impex [WordPress REST API](https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/).

- a [CLI](./impex-cli.md) for importing and exporting data from the commandline. You can use the [CLI](./impex-cli.md) to interact with a remote wordpress installation.

- an easy way to extend the import/export capabilities by third party plugins based on WordPress [actions](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/hooks/actions/) and [filters](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/hooks/filters/)
