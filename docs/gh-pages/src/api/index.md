## REST API

All ImpEx features are exposed by it's WordPress REST API endpoint.

The REST API is available at `/wp-json/cm4all-wp-impex/v1/`.

You can explore the ImpEx Rest API using any HTTP Rest API Client.

> Our favorite is the ["WP API SwaggerUI" WordPress Plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-api-swaggerui/) since it's perfectly integrated into WordPress.
