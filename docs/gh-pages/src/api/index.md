## REST API

All Impex features are exposed by a REST API smoothly integrated into WordPress Rest API.

The REST API is available at `/wp-json/cm4all-wp-impex/v1/`.

You can explore the Impex Rest API using any HTTP Rest API Client.

> Our favorite is the ["WP API SwaggerUI" WordPress Plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-api-swaggerui/) since it's perfectly integrated into WordPress.
