## REST API

All ImpEx features are exposed by it's WordPress REST API endpoint.

See [ImpEx REST API documentation](./cm4all-wp-impex-oas.md).

The REST API is also available as [OpenAPI Specification Format](https://swagger.io/specification/v2/) : Download [ImpEx OpenAPI Specification](http://0.0.0.0:3000/api/cm4all-wp-impex-oas.json) here.

You can explore the ImpEx Rest API using any HTTP Rest API Client.

> Our favorite is the ["WP API SwaggerUI" WordPress Plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-api-swaggerui/) since it's perfectly integrated into WordPress.
